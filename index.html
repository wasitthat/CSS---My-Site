      <p>I am a studying computer programmer. I like to make things with

        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="C" src="images/c-logo.png" alt="">

          <h3>C/C++</h3>
          <p class="skill-right">I've learned a lot about programming in C and C++, and I have
            taken courses on object oriented programming, algorithms, problem
            solving, ordered and unordered data structures, and fractal
            generators. This is where I started my path in computer
            programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="SQL" src="images/sql-logo.png" alt="">
          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p class="skill-left">I've taken some great courses on SQL. I learned all about efficient
            queries for accurate data analysis, data manipulation and table
            management.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="Python" src="images/python-logo.png" alt="">
          <h3>Python3</h3>
          <p class="skill-right">I am currently taking a course on Python3, which has now branched
            off into HTML and CSS. So far I have easily picked up automated
            email, sms, REST API's, applications and web design, so far a big
            favorite!</p>

        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="Excel" src="images/excel-logo.png" alt="">
          <h3>VBA</h3>
          <p class="skill-left">I was introduced to VBA through work, and found it intriguing
            enough to take a free online course in my own time to boost my
            report productivity. I learned all about Excel data manipulation and
            scripting through VBA.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="HTML" src="images/html-logo2.png" alt="">
          <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
          <p class="skill-right">I have known about the HTML viewer in Chrome for many years, I just
            didn't know really how to use it. Since taking a Python course I
            have had many 'ah ha!' moments and love web design!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="Cakewalk" src="images/cakewalk-logo.png" alt="">
          <h3>Cakewalk</h3>
          <p class="skill-left">Recording and producing music is one of my passions. I have been
            using digital audio workstations for many years and grew up in a
            recording studio environment. I was splicing 1/4" tape before my teens,
            and by my twenties I was well versed in midi connections and how
            powerful a well integrated midi studio was to making music. These days
            I like to produce amazing lightshows using midi, microcontrollers,
            leds and code.</p>
